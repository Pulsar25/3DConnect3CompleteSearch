3D Connect 4 is a board game where players drop rings onto pegs to form 4 in a row in a 4x4x4 grid. 
3D Connect 3 is the same but trying to get 3 in a row in a 3x3x3 grid.

This project is to complete search all the states in 3D Connect 3 in order to figure out whether or not it is solved in the same way that the original 7x6 Connect 4 is (the first player to move can always win in Connect 4).
